Q: What is an .mdfs file?
A: mdfs stands for M1dnightDev File System. 
   Its really just a a glorified txt with a 
   cool file extension.

Q: Why is there a .txt copy of every menu?
A: Its much easier to design a menu in a 
   .txt and then print it than typing it 
   directly in python. this is mainly 
   because you can't see exactly how multi- 
   line art would line up.

Q: Why is there a sfx folder with .unused 
   after the name?
A: I tried installing playsound but it       
   didn't work. I already had the sfx 
   downloaded and kept them for when I do 
   get playsound working. If the .unused it 
   gone, I probably fixed it.
